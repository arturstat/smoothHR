Smooth Hazard Ratio Curves Taking a Reference Value.

## Description
Provides flexible hazard ratio curves allowing non-linear relationships between continuous predictors and survival. To better understand the effects that each continuous covariate has on the outcome, results are expressed in terms of hazard ratio curves, taking a specific covariate value as reference. Confidence bands for these curves are also derived.
